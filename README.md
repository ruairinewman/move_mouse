# move_mouse
Python script to move mouse periodically

Make move_mouse.py executable, and run it from a shell prompt. It will move your mouse pointer to a random point on your screen periodically to stop your system from sleeping, and simulate activity and can be used to simulate activity to stop applications that periodically go to sleep even when the computer is prevented from doing so.

NB: Use Ctrl-C to exit.

Next update will allow specification of a max duration on the CLI
